Easy installation (requires Infinite Heaven)

Paste into /MGS_TPP/mods/modules/

If you don't want to install Infinite Heaven, you probably know enough how to install it yourself already.

Very early state at the moment, sticking it on here both to learn how Github works and so I can get more motivated to keep it up to date. Meant to be a Swiss Army Knife of features to help you in a pinch, using Shigu's camera framework menu as a basis for instant access. Currently includes:

*Quik-save - instant checkpoint save at your current location. Use it on the main menu, hit continue and you will be back in the chopper! (you may need to return to title screen and hit continue again for missions to load). Useful when you get the permenant loading screen glitch.

*Enable actions (only works in Mission 30 atm) - enables actions which are usually disabled, e.g. weapons in the Skull Face monologue, fulton recovery in the hospital mission.

*Instant health (currently doesn't work)

Big thanks to the people at MGSV Modding Community on Discord- one of the best and friendliest modding communities I have been part of. The stuff they are still coming up with almost two years on is amazing.
